# Project Overview

This document provides a summary of the main components of this project: the backend and the frontend.

## Backend

The backend of this project is a Python application built using the FastAPI framework. It is located in the `new_project_jules/backend/` directory.

Key features include:
- **API Development**: Leverages FastAPI for building robust and high-performance APIs.
- **Modular Design**: Organizes code into modules for different functionalities, such as user management and authentication.
- **Database Integration**: Includes middleware for database session management, indicating interaction with a database (likely using SQLAlchemy).
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration through `app.core.config`.
- **ASGI Server**: Designed to run with an ASGI server like Uvicorn.

For more details on the backend, please refer to the specific documentation and code within the `new_project_jules/backend/` directory.

## Frontend

The frontend is a sophisticated analytics dashboard located in the `new_project_jules/frontend/` directory. It is built using a modern JavaScript stack.

Key features and technologies include:
- **Framework/Libraries**: React, Vite, TypeScript, and Material-UI (MUI).
- **User Interface**:
    - A modular design with reusable UI components such as `MetricCard`, `ChartSection`, `FilterToolbar`, and `DataTable`.
    - Custom theming supporting light and dark modes, with user preferences saved locally.
    - Interactive data visualizations using Recharts (e.g., bar, line, and pie charts).
- **Layout**: A responsive `DashboardLayout` component provides the main application frame, including a header and a collapsible sidebar.
- **Performance**: Utilizes lazy loading for major components like `ChartSection` and `DataTable` to improve initial load times.
- **Data Handling**: Currently uses mock data for display, with clear guidelines provided in its README for integrating real API endpoints, potentially using a library like React Query.
- **Development & Build**: Uses Vite for a fast development experience and optimized production builds. Package management is handled by npm or yarn.
